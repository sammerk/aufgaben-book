Here we report the results of a preregistered replication attempt of Experiment 2 from Topolinski and Sparenberg (2012). Participants turned kitchen rolls either clockwise or counterclockwise while answering items from a questionnaire assessing openness to experience. Data from 102 participants showed that the effect went slightly in the direction opposite to that predicted by Topolinski and Sparenberg (2012), and a preregistered Bayes factor hypothesis test revealed that the data were 10.76 times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis. Our findings illustrate the theoretical importance and practical advantages of preregistered Bayes factor replication studies, both for psychological science and for empirical work in general.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional R will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

In particular, null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and its p value have been ubiquitous in published research for decades. Much more recently, null hypothesis Bayesian testing (NHBT) and its Bayes factor have also started to become more commonplace in applied research. Following preliminary work by Wong and colleagues, we investigated how, and to what extent, researchers misapply the Bayes factor in applied psychological research by means of a literature study. Based on a final sample of 167 articles, our results indicate that, not unlike NHST and the  p  value, the use of NHBT and the Bayes factor also shows signs of misconceptions. We consider the root causes of the identified problems and provide suggestions to improve the current state of affairs. This article is aimed to assist researchers in drawing the best inferences possible while using NHBT and the Bayes factor in applied research.},

Hence, so-called open-label placebos (OLPs) offer a new way to harness placebo effects ethically. To take this concept one step further, this study aimed at evaluating placebo effects without the use of a physical placebo, i.e., by imagining taking a pill. Healthy students (N\,=\,173) with self-reported test anxiety were either randomized to an imaginary pill (IP; n\,=\,55), an OLP (n\,=\,59) or a control group (CG; n\,=\,59). Both intervention groups were instructed to take two pills daily for three weeks. Primary outcome was test anxiety, secondary outcomes were sleep quality, general well-being and test performance. Groups test anxiety differed at study-endpoint, F(2,169)\,=\,11.50, p\,{$<$}\,.001. Test anxiety was lower in the intervention groups compared to the CG, t(169)\,=\,-\,4.44, p\,{$<$}\,.001, d\,=\,-\,0.71. The interventions did not differ significantly, i.e., both were similarly efficacious, t(169)\,=\,0.61, p\,=\,.540, d\,=\,0.11. The interaction between group and time in explaining test anxiety was significant, F(5,407.93)\,=\,6.13, p\,{$<$}\,.001. OLPs and IPs reduced test anxiety in healthy participants compared to the CG. This finding opens the door for a novel and ethical method to harness placebo effects.},

Bayesian statistics is often promoted as an ideal substitute for frequentists statistics since it coincides better with researchers' expectations and needs. A particular incidence of this is the proposal of replacing Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) by Null Hypothesis Bayesian Testing (NHBT) using the Bayes factor. In this paper, it is studied to what extent the usability and expectations of NHBT match well. First, a study of the reporting practices in 73 psychological publications was carried out. It was found that eight Questionable Reporting and Interpreting Practices (QRIPs) occur more than once among the practitioners when doing NHBT. Specifically, our analysis provides insight into possible mismatches and their occurrence frequencies. A follow-up survey study has been conducted to assess such mismatches. The sample (N = 108) consisted of psychology researchers, experts in methodology (and/or statistics), and applied researchers in fields other than psychology. The data show that discrepancies exist among the participants. Interpreting the Bayes Factor as posterior odds and not acknowledging the notion of relative evidence in the Bayes Factor are arguably the most concerning ones. The results of the paper suggest that a shift of statistical paradigm cannot solve the problem of misinterpretation altogether if the users are not well acquainted with the tools.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

  abstract = {In 1936, Sir Harold Jeffreys proposed an approximate objective Bayes factor that quantifies the degree to which the point-null hypothesis H0 outpredicts the alternative hypothesis H1. This approximate Bayes factor (henceforth JAB01) depends only on sample size and on how many standard errors the maximum likelihood estimate is away from the point under test. We revisit JAB01 and introduce a piecewise transformation that clarifies the connection to the frequentist two-sided p-value. Specifically, if p {$\leq$} .10 then JAB01 {$\approx$} 3p{$\surd$}n; if .10 \&lt; p {$\leq$} .50 then JAB01 {$\approx$} {$\surd$}(pn); and if p \&gt; .50 then JAB01 {$\approx$} p\^(1/4){$\surd$}n. These transformation rules present p-value practitioners with a straightforward opportunity to obtain Bayesian benefits such as the ability to monitor evidence as data accumulate without reaching a foregone conclusion. Using the JAB01 framework we derive simple and accurate approximate Bayes factors for the t-test, the binomial test, the comparison of two proportions, and the correlation test.},

  abstract = {This article explains a decision rule that uses Bayesian posterior distributions as the basis for accepting or rejecting null values of parameters. This decision rule focuses on the range of plausible values indicated by the highest density interval of the posterior distribution and the relation between this range and a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) around the null value. The article also discusses considerations for setting the limits of a ROPE and emphasizes that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds for p values and Bayes factors.},
